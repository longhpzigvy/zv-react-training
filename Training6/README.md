# Training 6 - Advanced React: Redux Middleware

## Overview
- Setup a middleware for Redux
- Using Redux Saga middleware for side-effect handling, calling API, and background job*
- Redux persist for persisting data
- Redux devtool extension middleware for debugging redux with Redux Devtools Ext
- Debugging Redux with Redux Devtools Ext

## Goal
- Understanding the role of Redux middlware
- Can config redux persist, redux saga by yourself
- Able to config another redux middleware without any problems
- Understanding and able to debug Redux state with Redux Devtools Ext

## Plan
- One pair programming section


## Reading (Optional)
- [Redux persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist)
- [Redux saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga)

  - The app can be worked offline or online, the user can create a task without submitting immediately, every task created should get status: Draft
  - "Draft" means "I still want to edit and don't want to submit yet"
  - "Ready" means "I finalized the task and want to move it to Submit Queue"
  - Submit Queue only working when the network status is Online, otherwise the Submit Queue should be pending until network status become Online
  - That's meaning in the online network, every ready task will be submitted by Submit Queue automatically, otherwise ready tasks should still be Ready until network status become Online
  - When Submit Queue submit task one by one in Online mode, the status change to Submitting automatically
  - We only have an API to submit the task to the backend, we will mock it by yield delay(2000) and random 50-50 submit successfully for failed
  - User can click on the status to manually change status, please review the dashed arrow to know what status can be manually updated and the next status of them
  - Move the network status listener to redux-saga using even channel
