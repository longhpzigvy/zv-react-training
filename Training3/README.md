## Tasks and Requimenets

- Being evil, let's create a simple key logger. Using DOM Event Listener to listen for user's input. You can only listen for user's input when a modal is openned. Otherwise, do nothing
- In short, create a website that with a `Open Modal` button. On the modal will be a single free text input/textarea.
- When a button is clicked, show a modal and starting to listen for user's input
- Please note that we should add listener to user's input even user is not typing text input/textarea: using `document.addEventListener`
- Everything should be written down (including Enter, Backspace, Delete button, etc) in the component that have `Open Modal` button
