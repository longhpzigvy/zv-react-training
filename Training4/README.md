## Overview
- Using `fetch` API to get data from API
- Using state, props to transfer data from API around components
- Using `axios` as a replacement of `fetch` API

## Goal
- Understanding `debounce` and `throttle`
- Understanding CORS problem
- Create a simple app that use external API to get and display the data

## Plan
- Pair programming with mentor
